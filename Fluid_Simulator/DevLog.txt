Problem 1
	Undertand what the teacher wants us to do, I had to ask him directly. 

Problem 2
	Solids were pretty tricky 

Problem 3
	the part for the velocity crashes, had to create editor.py 

Problem 4
	the anim.save() line on fluid.py does not seem to work, I don't know if my machine cant read it because of the path, I had to record my screen and edit the videos myself.
